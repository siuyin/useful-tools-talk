37,Safe Cycling in Singapore,"The safest option is to cycle along park connectors. The Rail Corridor stands out as it traverses the island north-south. However park connectors do not always bring you to where you need to go, thus it is generally safe to cycle along main road. Non-powered bicycles are allowed on pavements but powered bicycles are not permitted on pavement or park connectors. You can cycle along Westcost Highway. Legally you may also cycle on  Lornie Highway but I would not recommend it, instead use the pavement on the road heading from Bukit Timah to Bishan, use it in both directions. Wear a helment for safety and have a font white light to help you see at hight and be seen by traffic. Also have a rear red blinker to make you more visible to traffic.",Singapore,

39,Reliable and good value durian seller at Batu Ferringhi,"There is a street vendor that sells durians from his motorcycle. He is located at Persiaran Sungei Emas, near the Uplands International School. His durians are about RM25 per packet but can go as high at RM32. He offers D15 and Capri varieties and the occasional kampung durian. The D15 is deep yellow with a thick flesh and small seed. It leans on to the sweet side. Capri, in contrast is more on the bitter side with a hint of grassiness. Capri is a thinner flesh but is equally tasty. We have also bought rambutans and chempedak from him.",Penang,
